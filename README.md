### Yatzy Refactoring Kata

There is a [video](https://youtu.be/SvcJKNF_nRQ) explaining this refactoring kata. It is also used in the videos [Unlock the Power of Refactoring in Everyday OO Design](https://youtu.be/sngRW3zPiiE) and [Reduce Method Sprawl with Code Paragraphs](https://youtu.be/tPz1riXOrYk).

<br />

#### Kata Description

The problem that this code is designed to solve is explained here: [Yatzy](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/yatzy.html)

<br />

#### Contributing to this Kata

Please do not send me your refactored solutions. I am however grateful for language translations and updates to dependencies.

I recently added new refactoring challenges to the Java version and I would appreciate translations of Yatzy2 in other languages. Yatzy3 is still under development as an exercise so hold off on translating that one for the moment.

<br />

#### Code Reading Practice

Test your code reading skills. Here is a description of what to do: [Scanning for Code Smells](https://sammancoaching.org/exercises/code_reading.html). There are suitable lists of urls to open in some of the language subdirectories.

#### Acknowlegements
